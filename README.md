# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-COVID-19-Clinical-Trials

ClinicalTrials.gov is a database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world. It is maintained by the National Institute of Health. All data is publicly available and the site provides a direct download feature which makes it super easy to use relevant data for analysis.

This dataset consists of clinical trials related to COVID 19 studies presented on the site.

The dataset consists of 5783 XML files where each XML file corresponds to one study. The filename is the NCT number which a unique identifier of a study in ClinicalTrials repository.

I have converted these XML files to a dataframe using ElementTree, a built-in python library to manipulate XML files and I have performed exploratory data analysis on this dataset
